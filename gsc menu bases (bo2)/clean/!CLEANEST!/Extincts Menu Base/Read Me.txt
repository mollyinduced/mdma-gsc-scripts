	How to add submenus;
		To add submenus you need to do the following. Add a Option under the 'main' submenu. for example like this.
			self addOpt("<OPTION NAME>", "<OPTION DESCRIPTION>",::newMenu,"<SUBMENU NAME>");
				Once you have done that you would need to add a 'addMenu' then add options underneath that, here is an example.
					self addMenu("<SUBMENU NAME>", "<SUBMENU TITLE>");
						If you would like a access level set on a certain sub menu you simply do the following
							self addMenu("<SUBMENU NAME>", "<SUBMENU TITLE>", "<ACCESS LEVELS>");
								if you would like to do a shader menu you would do the following
									self addMenu("<SUBMENU NAME>", "<SUBMENU TITLE>", "<ACCESS LEVELS>", "<SHADER WIDTH;SHADER HEIGHT>");//NOTE you need a semicolon inbetween the width and height
	How to add options;
		To add options you need to do the following, under your 'self addMenu("<SUBMENU NAME>", "<SUBMENU TITLE>");'
			self addOpt("<OPTION NAME>", "OPTION DESCRIPTION",<::FUNCTION CALL>); //NOTE: YOU CAN USE 5 PARAMETERS AFTER THE FUNCTION CALL
	How to add option sliders:
		To add option sliders you need to do the following, under your 'self addMenu("<SUBMENU NAME>", "<SUBMENU TITLE>");' you need to add 
			self addOptSlider("<OPTION NAME>", "OPTION DESCRIPTION", <::FUNCTION CALL>, "<LIST>");
				Example of a slider function list: "Speed;1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8"
